## Updates 🆙
### 1.0.1
- Cleaned up some code 🧹 , changed description.
### 1.0.2
- The API I was using, <a href="https://type.fit/api/quotes">typefit</a> , seemed to have broken somehow 😅. Migrated to <a href="https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable">Quotable</a>, an open source quotes API by <a href="https://github.com/lukePeavey">Luke Peavey</a>.
### 1.0.3
- Added a secondary API from <a href="https://api-ninjas.com/">API Ninjas</a> to fallback to. <a href="https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable">Quotable</a> seems to go down alot either due to an expired DNSSEC key or a high volume of requests.
### 1.0.4
- Fixed/cleaned some code. Changed error handling to log errors to both the console and the extension.
### 1.0.5 / 1.0.6
- Migrated to the latest Manifest V3 JSON format, imported the extension to [Firefox 🦊](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/quotey-inspirational-quotes/) and [Microsoft Edge 🌌](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/quotey-inspirational-quotes/).
